# titanic_competition
This small, personal project demonstrates my skillset in data science and my knowledge of popular machine learning tools in Python, such as the library Scikit-Learn.

The purpose of this project is to predict survivors of the RMS *Titanic*, which sank on April 15th 1912 after an iceberg collision in the North Atlantic Ocean. We have passenger information provided in a dataset titled `train.csv`, which include passenger fare, family members, ticket number, port of embarkation, socioeconomic class, among other information unique to each passenger.

We start with some descriptive analysis of the dataset, wherein we observe the columns and data types available to us in the dataset. Then, in an exploratory analysis we check the relationships between data features and our target variable. Finally, we perform a predictive analysis to optimize the parameters of several machine learning models that we use to predict survival.
