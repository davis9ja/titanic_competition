# titanic_competition
This small, personal project demonstrates my skillset in data science and my knowledge of popular machine learning tools in Python, such as the library Scikit-Learn.

The purpose of this project is to predict survivors of the RMS *Titanic*, which sank on April 15th 1912 after an iceberg collision in the North Atlantic Ocean. We have passenger information provided in a dataset titled `train.csv`, which include passenger fare, family members, ticket number, port of embarkation, socioeconomic class, among other information unique to each passenger.

We start with some descriptive analysis of the dataset.
